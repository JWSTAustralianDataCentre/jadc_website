							<p> We are planning a second JWST Master Class in Melbourne (Swinburne University Hawthorn Campus) between Nov 30th to Dec 2nd 2022 to assist the Australian community in familiarizing themselves with the proposal process and technical capabilities of JWST. Proposals for JWST are quite complex as they need to incorporate a complete observing program specification in the Astronomers Proposal Tool (i.e. what are traditionally known as ‘Phase 1’ and ‘Phase 2’ are combined for JWST). Additionally many Australian astronomers have obtained Cycle 1 or public data and are working on data reduction. We plan to run hands on training on JWST data and tools. 
							</p>

							<p>Please fill out the registration form below by the 4th of November 2022 to secure a spot! This event is being financially sponsored by the Australian Space Agency, for which we extremely grateful. Therefore, we will have some travel funding available for attendees. </p>

										Successfully launched on 25 December 2021, NASA’s successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has taken its first images and will be released to the public 12 July. Join Professor Karl Glazebrook, Dr Themiya Nanayakkara and Dr Colin Jacobs, as they discuss these images and the potential secrets of the universe they reveal. Dr Nicha Leethochawalit from University of Melbourne will share her work on redshifted galaxies. No registration required. Details of event can be found <a href="https://www.swinburne.edu.au/events/2022/08/free-public-astronomy-lecture-unlocking-the-universes-secrets-with-jwst.html//" target="_blank">here</a>.

										In the anticipation of the JWST Cycle 1 call for proposals in early 2020, We are organising a workshop aimed at researchers based in Australia/New Zealand to familiarise with JWST observing modes and proposal planning tools. The workshop will be held in Melbourne at Swinburne University from 26 to 28th February 2020 and will be delivered by Australian researchers trained at NASA/ESA Master Classes. More information about the workshop and the registration details can be found <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/JWST/jwstmasterclass2020melbourne/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
